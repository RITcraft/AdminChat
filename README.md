RITcraft AdminChat
==================

Bukkit/Spigot plugin for Minecraft servers that allows admins to privately message each other in-game


## About

AdminChat is a simple Bukkit/Spigot plugin for Minecraft servers that allows administrators to privately message each other in-game as a group. This allows them to hold private discussions on the server without the public seeing their messages. This is a quick and handy plugin for a single, small server.

AdminChat was created by Chris Bitler for RITcraft.
