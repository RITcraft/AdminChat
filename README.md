RITCraft Admin Chat
===========


AdminChat is a plugin created by Chris Bitler for RITCraft.
This is simply to allow the admins to message each other out of the public eye, to discuss any stuff they need to within the server.


##Permissions
ritcraft.adminchat lets them use the /a [message] command and just /a to enter admin chat mode.
